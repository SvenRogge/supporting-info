## MIL-53(Al)

The MIL-53(Al) folder contains three subfolders:

1. *ff*: contains the force field and the initial geometry used to perform the simulations
2. *NPsT*: contains the python scripts for the $(N,P,  \bm \sigma_a =\bm 0, T)$  simulations
3. *NVsT*: contains the python scripts for the $(N,V,  \bm \sigma_a =\bm 0, T)$  simulations, as well as the intermediate and final results of the pressure equations of state for each of the supercells. These files contain two columns: the first column is the supercell volume (in ångström), the second column the averaged internal pressure (in MPa)


## DMOF-1(Zn)

The DMOF-1(Zn) folder contains three subfolders:

1. *ff*: contains the force field and the initial geometry used to perform the simulations
2. *NPsT*: contains the python scripts for the $(N,P,  \bm \sigma_a =\bm 0, T)$  simulations
3. *NVsT*: contains the python scripts for the $(N,V,  \bm \sigma_a =\bm 0, T)$  simulations, as well as the intermediate and final results of the pressure equations of state. These files contain two columns: the first column is the supercell volume (in ångström), the second column the averaged internal pressure (in MPa)


## MIL-53(Al)-F

The MIL-53(Al)-F folder contains three subfolders:

1. *ff*: contains the force field and the initial geometry used to perform the simulations
2. *NPsT*: contains the python scripts for the $(N,P,  \bm \sigma_a =\bm 0, T)$  simulations
3. *NVsT*: contains the python scripts for the $(N,V,  \bm \sigma_a =\bm 0, T)$  simulations, as well as the intermediate and final results of the pressure equations of state at 100 K, 300 K, and 500 K. These files contain two columns: the first column is the supercell volume (in ångström), the second column the averaged internal pressure (in MPa)

## CoBDP

The CoBDP folder contains three subfolders:

1. *ff*: contains the force field and the initial geometry used to perform the simulations
2. *NPsT*: contains the python scripts for the $(N,P,  \bm \sigma_a =\bm 0, T)$  simulations
3. *NVsT*: contains the python scripts for the $(N,V,  \bm \sigma_a =\bm 0, T)$  simulations, as well as the intermediate and final results of the pressure equations of state at methane loadings of 0, 2, and 4 molecules per conventional unit cell. These files contain two columns: the first column is the supercell volume (in ångström), the second column the averaged internal pressure (in MPa)
